# VPC with Terraform

The Terraform configuration below:

* Creates a VPC
* Creates an Internet Gateway and attaches it to the VPC to allow traffic within the VPC to be reachable by the outside world.
* Creates a public and private subnet
* Creates a route table for the public and private subnets and associates the table with both subnets
* Creates a NAT Gateway to enable private subnets to reach out to the internet without needing an externally routable IP address assigned to each resource.

1. Run the `terraform init` command in the same directory. The terraform init command initializes the plugins and providers which are required to work with resources.

1. Run the `terraform plan` command. This is an optional, yet recommended action to ensure your configurationâ€™s syntax is correct and gives you an overview of which resources will be provisioned in your infrastructure.

1. Provision the AWS VPC and resources using `terraform apply`.

When we need to stop this deployment use the command; `terraform destroy`
