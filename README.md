### Building this booklet locally but with docker

In some cases you might not want to alter your Python setup and rather go with a docker image instead. This requires docker is running locally on your computer though.

* docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material
* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.

### Pushing the book to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure that all your local changes to the `main` branch have been committed and pushed to the remote repository. `git push origin main`
1. Run `mkdocs gh-deploy --remote-branch main` from the root directory.
